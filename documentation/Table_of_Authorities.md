## Full Case Citation

A **Full Case Citation** provides complete information necessary to find the reported decision at its source and typically includes the following elements:

- **Names of the Parties**: Includes the name of the plaintiff and the defendant as they appear in the case docket or heading.
- **Volume Number**: The volume number of the reporter in which the case is published.
- **Reporter Abbreviation**: The standard abbreviation of the reporter where the case is published; for example, U.S. (United States Reports), F.3d (Federal Reporter, Third Series), etc.
- **Starting Page Number**: The page number on which the case begins.
- **Year of Decision**: The year in which the case was decided, usually enclosed in parentheses.
- **Court and Jurisdiction** (optional): Sometimes included to provide additional context, especially if the reporter covers multiple jurisdictions.

### Example of a Full Case Citation:

- *Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)*

This tells you that the Roe v. Wade decision can be found in volume 410 of the United States Reports starting at page 113, and the decision was issued in 1973.

## Short Case Citation

A **Short Case Citation** is used when a case has already been cited in full earlier in a document. This shorter form omits much of the detail because the reader can refer back to the full citation for all the particulars. Short citations typically include:

- **A Recognizable Form of the Case Name**: Often just the plaintiff’s name or a shortened version of the full case name.
- **Volume and Page Number**: If citing a specific point within the case not previously cited, this includes only the pinpoint citation, not the entire reporter information again.
- **Id.**: If the citation directly follows the case being cited without any intervening citations, "Id." or "Ibid." can be used, sometimes followed by a pinpoint citation to a specific page.

### Examples of Short Case Citations:

- *410 U.S. at 120* – indicating that additional information is found on page 120 of the same volume.
- *Roe, at 120* – assuming that "Roe" is identifiable as a previously cited case.
- *Id. at 121* – indicating that the information is on page 121 of the case immediately cited before this one.

## Usage

- **Full Case Citations** are used the first time a case is cited in a document to provide full reference details.
- **Short Case Citations** are used for subsequent citations to the same case, saving space and avoiding redundancy, making legal documents easier to read without cluttering them with repetitive information.
